Art is a way for humans to express their creativity, and for tens of thousands of millenia, art has evolved in unimaginable ways. Saigon Art Map is a collective map of all things art in Ho Chi Minh, wether it be Art Galleries, Art Shops, Museums, Venues, Halls or anything else, you name it. This project was started by Mai Do in 2016, and it continues to grow as a massive collection of art addresses. Mai imagines a day where Saigon Art Map is a massive online network, as well as physical hard copies, which can be used to explore the history and culture of this city.
